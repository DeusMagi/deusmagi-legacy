== Map Editor ==

To run Gridarta for Atrinik - the Atrinik map editor - you'll need Java 1.6 or
later. Download it from the Java website (http://www.java.com).

Note that on some versions of Java (generally the newer ones), you have to
manually set the PATH environment variable. See this for instructions:
http://www.jibble.org/settingupjava.php

When you're finished setting up Java, double-click w32_start_editor.bat to start
the editor.

== Server ==

You need to download Python 3.4 from the Python website (http://www.python.org)
and install it to the default location.

Simply double-click w32_start_server.bat and the server should start.

== Client ==

Double-click w32_start_client.bat.

== Map Checker ==

Map checker is a tool to check your maps located in tools/map-checker-qt. To run
it, you need Python 3.4 and PyQt5, which can be downloaded here:
