## Licensing

All the code and content is released under GNU GPL v2. Assets such as graphics
sound effects and music files come from many artists and various sources, so
each asset has its own LICENSE file, crediting the original author. Typically
the licenses for these are either GPLv2 or some version of CC-BY.

## History

Around late 2008 and early 2009, Atrinik started out as a prototype game
project based on the source and content of a specific version of Daimonin
(which claimed to be entirely GPLv2 at the time),

Around 2011, the codebase was rebased using Crossfire as the base to start
off fresh. Since then, the code has been rewritten several times over until
reaching a final iteration of backend concepts based on Crossfire ideas,
while taking into consideration the concepts of Angelion - such as 2.5D and
map-stacking.
