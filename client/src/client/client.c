/**
 * @file
 * Client interface main routine.
 *
 * This file sets up a few global variables, connects to the server,
 * tells it what kind of pictures it wants, adds the client and enters
 * the main event loop (event_loop()) checks the tcp socket for input and
 * then polls for x events. This should be fixed since you can just block
 * on both filedescriptors.
 *
 * The DoClient function receives a message (an ArgList), unpacks it, and
 * in a slow for loop dispatches the command to the right function
 * through the commands table. ArgLists are essentially like RPC things,
 * only they don't require going through RPCgen, and it's easy to get
 * variable length lists. They are just lists of longs, strings,
 * characters, and byte arrays that can be converted to a machine
 * independent format.
